So, you want to set up your own version of Iceage?

IceAge runs as a bunch of CGI scripts, so it should work on any server with Apache, Ruby (1.8) and MySQL installed.

You'll find a database template in dbtemplate.sql. You'll need to create a MySQL database called 'iceage'; the command to import the data should be something like 'mysql -p iceage < dbtemplate.sql'. If you want to check the import worked, open the MySQL prompt and type 'show tables;' - you should see 12 table names.

Getting Ruby to talk to MySQL is not hard. Install Ruby (e.g. ruby-1.9.1), and the Ruby-dev package that matches your version of Ruby (e.g. ruby-1.9.1-dev). Then use gem to install mysql2.

The file 'mysql-connect.rb' handles the database connection for iceage, so make sure you change the settings there; in particular, 'root' should be changed for your username and '' with your password.

IceAge isn't the best example of Ruby code; in particular, it's not very object-oriented, because the designer (of Shintolin) didn't properly understand object-orientation when he began working on version II of the game. There's probably a few other things he'd do differently now - still, you should see the orginal PHP version.  I am working on porting IceAge over to Rails.

The file test.rb might include a few failing tests; this doesn't neccesarily mean the game is broken. It's quite brittle in regards to the database (this is something that Ruby on Rails manages to fix, more or less, but it's method is complicated). Test coverage is also not very high, because I didn't start writing tests until very late into the project. Improving the testing framework might be a good way to get your head around the code base.

If your changes are good, I'm not averse to adding them to the master version of IceAge. E-mail me at: iceage AT kellerlan DOT net and I'll see what I can do.

Happy hacking!
